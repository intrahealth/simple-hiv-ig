# Simple HIV (for testing only)

## Quick start

### Configure HAPI FHIR Server to process CQL/Measures.

> Note that the HAPI Docker image doesn't include the feature, the server must be run from the JAR or rebuilt with the JAR and then put into your own container.

Clone hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter
```
git clone git@github.com:hapifhir/hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter.git
cd hapi-fhir-jpaserver-starter
```
Uncomment the cql line in src/main/resources/application.yaml so that it is enabled.
```sh
#    auto_create_placeholder_reference_targets: false
    cql_enabled: true
#    default_encoding: JSON
```
Run HAPI
```
mvn jetty:run
```

### Prepare and load synthetic data

See https://github.com/intrahealth/synthea-hiv

For example:
```sh
docker run intrahealth/synthea-hiv:pop100
```

### Prepare this repo

Clone this repo

```sh
git clone git@github.com:intrahealth/simple-hiv-ig.git
cd simple-hiv-ig
```

Run Publisher and create resources. Resources are put in /output
```sh
# only need first time
bash _updatePublisher
# run every time
bash _genonce.sh
```

PUT the Library resources. We use PUT to ensure that the id is always the same and when changes are made they overwrite the resource with those updates.
```sh
cd output
# library resources
for FILE in FHIRHelpers FHIRCommon AgeRanges \
HIVSimpleAgeGroup HIVSimpleCondition HIVSimpleDemog HIVSimpleGender HIVSimpleTestResult HIVSimpleViralLoad \
; do curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/fhir+json" --data @Library-${FILE}.json http://localhost:8080/fhir/Library/${FILE} ; done
```

PUT the Measure resources
```sh
for FILE in HIVSimpleAgeGroup HIVSimpleCondition HIVSimpleDemog HIVSimpleGender HIVSimpleTestResult HIVSimpleViralLoad \
; do curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/fhir+json" --data @Measure-${FILE}.json http://localhost:8080/fhir/Measure/${FILE} ; done
```

Run a provided example in the browser
```
http://localhost:8080/fhir/Measure/HIVSimpleGender/$evaluate-measure?periodStart=1970-01-01&periodEnd=2021-01-01
http://localhost:8080/fhir/Measure/HIVSimpleAgeGroup/$evaluate-measure?periodStart=1970-01-01&periodEnd=2021-01-01
http://localhost:8080/fhir/Measure/HIVSimpleDemog/$evaluate-measure?periodStart=1970-01-01&periodEnd=2021-01-01
http://localhost:8080/fhir/Measure/HIVSimpleTestResult/$evaluate-measure?periodStart=1970-01-01&periodEnd=2021-01-01
http://localhost:8080/fhir/Measure/HIVSimpleCondition/$evaluate-measure?periodStart=1970-01-01&periodEnd=2021-01-01
http://localhost:8080/fhir/Measure/HIVSimpleViralLoad/$evaluate-measure?periodStart=1970-01-01&periodEnd=2021-01-01
```

## Authoring

Implementation Guides are the FHIR community's supported approach to authorship, creation of Library and Measure resources, versioning. The Atom editor and package for CQL are recommended for iterating on CQL.

* Install the Atom editor and [Atom CQL language package](https://github.com/cqframework/atom_cql_support).
* To test that your setup is working, clone this repo, open a CQL file then make sure you have focus on the CQL file. Then right-click and at the bottom will be the CQL menu to `Execute CQL`. This will bring up a results window as it processes tests.

The folder structure must be set up accordingly (from [Atom CQL language package](https://github.com/cqframework/atom_cql_support)):
```
input/cql
input/tests
input/tests/<cql-library-name>
input/tests/<cql-library-name>/<patient-id>
input/tests/<cql-library-name>/<patient-id>/<resource-type-name>/<resource files> // flexible structure
input/vocabulary/codesystem
input/vocabulary/valueset
```
Observe the above or there will be issues.

For example:
* The CQL files are all under `input/cql`
* Library and Measure templates are under `input/resources`. They must be named and fields match the CQL files.
* The `_genonce` script in Publisher will convert those template Library and Measure resources into full resources that can be PUT on a FHIR server.
* Tests must have the `resource.id` of the resource as a folder name. Thus, there is a separate folder for each Patient bundle.
* The Patient bundles inside the folder can actually be named anything, but they are named here by `resource.id`.

> Patient bundles for tests do not have to be complex (these were generated by a custom Synthea module), but they must have the codesystems required in the CQL. It is important to determine codesystems in advance to author CQL or create temp ones while doing authorship.

* There must be an `input/vocabulary/valueset` folder even if it is empty.

Some hints on authorship from recent workshops:
* Double quotes are for identifiers and single quotes represent string literals, for example, "female" should be 'female'.
* Check for odd copy/paste errors in quotes.
* Required libraries: `include FHIRHelpers version '4.0.1'` Use of FHIRHelpers is implicit in the translator, based on the modelinfo file with FHIR. This must be included in the boilerplate of any CQL that processes FHIR.
