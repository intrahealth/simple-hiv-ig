# notes
# canonicals: canonical URL serves as a stable logical identifier for the resource, 
# and is the preferred way to reference a conformance or knowledge resource.

# urn:uuid in fhir must be lowercase in fhir

# item identifiers: If the item has a name, the id SHOULD be based on the itemâ€™s name, 
# with _ replaced by -, changed to lowercase, and truncated if necessary

# cant submit urn:uuid in separate linked bundles

# all bundles are submitted as POST
#  urn:uuid
# in instance
# Reference(noquotes urn:uuid)
#  in bundle 
# .reference (leave out urn:uuid, no quotes): .resource = aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-e00111100001
# fullUrl = "urn:uuid:aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-e00111100003"
# urn:uuid in a bundle trans bundle then hapi will resolve them
# or just uuid - just generate them, then PUT in the trans bundle
# if POST: urn:uuid:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000
# fullurl can be: urn:uuid:123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426655440000
# if you want to preserve DHIS2 UIDs you can do v3 UUID which is an md5 hash (of the UID) 
# that was the approach we did with (m)CSD facade for DHIS2
# for v3: generate v3
# preserve actual uid as identifier

# OSSP uuid - Universally Unique Identifier Command-Line Tool
# For version 3 and version 5 UUIDs the additional command line arguments namespace and name have to be given. 
# The namespace is either a UUID in string representation or an identifier for internally pre-defined namespace UUIDs 
# (currently known are "ns:DNS", "ns:URL", "ns:OID", and "ns:X500"). The name is a string of arbitrary length.
